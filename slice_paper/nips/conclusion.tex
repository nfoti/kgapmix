We presented the class of normalized kernel CRMs, a type of dependent 
normalized random measure.  This class generalizes previous work
by allowing more flexibility in the underlying CRM and kernel function used to
induce dependence.
We developed a slice sampler to perform inference on the infinite
dimensional measure and compared this method with samplers for a finite 
approximation and for the SNGP.  We found that the slice sampler yields
samples with competitive predictive accuracy at a fraction of the computational
cost.

There are many directions for future research.  
Incorporating
reversible-jump moves \cite{Green:Hastie:2009} such as split-merge proposals
should allow the slice sampler to explore larger regions of the parameter space
with a limited decrease in computational efficiency. A similar methodology may yield efficient inference algorithms for KCRMs such as the KBP, extending the existing slice sampler for the Indian Buffet Process
\cite{TehGorGha2007}.
